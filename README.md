# Ultimate Godot Game Developer Projects eLearning
Game development becomes interesting and fun when you use Godot. It is an open-source platform with sound support from its community. For beginners, Godot offers a friendly way to learn game development techniques, while for experienced developers it is a powerful, customizable tool that can bring your visions to life.

This course covers the entire spectrum of game development from the absolute basics to sophisticated game physics, animation, and other techniques. While building these games, you will learn various concepts, such as how the Godot editor works, how to structure a project, and what are kinematic bodies. Whether it is working with vectors and coordinate systems or it is building a dynamic, scalable UI, this course teaches you everything to get you started with the Godot game engine and editor.

By the end of this course, you will have learned how Godot works and discovered important game development techniques that you can apply to your projects.



## What you will learn
* Use Godot’s node and scene system to design robust, reusable game objects
* Write code in GDScript to capture input and build complex behaviors
* Use container nodes to organize and keep UI nodes aligned
* Navigate through the 3D editor to view and place nodes using gizmo
* Create visual effects to spice up your game
* Learn how Godot’s physics works and implement a basic finite state machine



### Hardware requirements
For an optimal learning experience, you will require the computer systems with at least the following:
* **Processor**: Dual Core or better
* **Memory**: 4GB RAM
* **Storage**: 10 GB available space



### Software requirements
You'll also need the following software installed in advance:
* Operating system: Windows 7 SP1 32/64-bit, Windows 8.1 32/64-bit or Windows 10 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 14.04 or later, or macOS Sierra or later
* Browser: Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
* Conda
* Jupyterlab

Access to installation instructions can be provided separately to course material for large training centers and organizations. All source code is publicly available on GitHub and fully referenced within the training material.

## Note:

To best understand the example code in this book, you should have a general knowledge of programming, preferably with a modern, dynamically-typed language such as Python or Javascript. If you're new to programming entirely, you may wish to review a beginner Python tutorial before diving into the game projects in this book.

Godot will run on any relatively modern PC running Windows, mac OS, or Linux operating systems. Your video card must support OpenGL ES 3.0.
